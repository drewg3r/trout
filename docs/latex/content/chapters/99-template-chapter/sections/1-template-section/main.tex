\section{Template section}
\label{sec:template-section}


Hi, I am a latex section!

Please, use the same pattern for naming sections as for naming chapters.

Section can contain multiple subsections. You can place them next to the
section's \lstin{main.tex}. Use this name convention for subsections:
\lstin{\{subsection\_number\}-subsection-name.tex}. Than, you can include your
sections in \lstin{main.tex}

For problem definition, see \ref{chap:problem-definition} chapter.

Also, you can have a look at the KPI picture \ref{fig:kpi}

% Subsections
\input{content/chapters/99-template-chapter/sections/1-template-section/1-template-subsection.tex}
